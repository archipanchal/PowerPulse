# Electricity Demand Projection using LSTM
This project forecasts electricity demand using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. It processes historical power consumption data, trains an LSTM model, and predicts future electricity demand.

### 📌 Project Overview
Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization
Training an LSTM model for time series forecasting
Evaluating model performance using MAE, RMSE, and R² score
Visualizing actual vs. predicted demand
Saving and loading the trained model for future predictions

### 🛠 Technologies Used
Python 
TensorFlow/Keras
Pandas,
NumPy 
Matplotlib,
Seaborn Scikit-learn
